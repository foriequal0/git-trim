git-trim
========

![git-trim Logo](./logo.png)

`git-trim` automatically trims your remote tracking branches that are merged or gone.

## Instruction

1. Download the binary from [Release](https://github.com/foriequal0/git-trim/releases), and put it in your `PATH`
1. Don't forget to set an upstream for a branch that you want to trim automatically. `git push -u <remote> <branch>` will set upstream when you push.
1. Run `git trim` if you need to trim branches especially after PR reviews. It'll automatically recognize merged or gone branches, and delete it.
1. If you need more power, try `git trim --filter all`
1. You can also `git trim --dry-run` when you don't trust me.

## Why I've made this?

Git's PR workflow is a little bit tedious as a routine.
There are so many lines of commands to type and many statuses of branches that corresponding to PRs that you've sent.
Were they merged or rejected? Did I forget to delete the remote branch after it is merged?

After the PR is merged or rejected, you're likely to do this:
```shell script
git remote update --prune

# Cleaning your branch.
git branch --delete --force feature/patch1
# When forgot to delete the remote branch in the GitHub web UI
git push --delete origin feature/patch1
```
You repeat these same commands as much as PRs that you've sent.
You have to remember what branch is for the PR that just have been closed and it is easy to make a mistake.
I feel nervous whenever I put `--force` flag. Rebase merge forces to me to use `--force` (no pun is intended).
`git reflog` is a fun command to play with, isn't it? Also `git remote update` and `git push` is not instantaneous.
I hate to wait for the prompt even it is a fraction of a second when I have multiple commands to type.

That's why I've made `git-trim`.
It knows whether a branch is merged into the default base branch, or whether it is rejected.
It can even `push --delete` when you forgot to delete the remote branch if needed.

## What is the difference between `merged` and `gone` branch?

A merged branch is a branch that you can safely remove them.
It is already merged into the base branch, so you're not going to lose the changes.

However, your PRs are sometimes rejected and deleted from the remote.
Or you might forget the fact that the PR is merged.
So you might have been mistakenly amended or rebased the branch and the patch is now completely different from the patch that is merged.
Then it is `gone`, which means that you might lose your changes. The term is borrowed from the git's remote tracking states.
